Run some example calculations with Netsci.

Be sure that Netsci is installed and the correct Conda environment
is loaded:

conda activate netsci

# Independent Gaussian Data

As a very simple example of how Netsci can be used to find the mutual
information (MI) between two sets of data, run the following 
script to generate random data sampled from independent Gaussian 
distributions:

```
python make_two_cols_indep_data.py
```

That will create a file named "sample.dat", which has two columns, 
representing each independent distribution, and 100 rows, which are
instances sampled from the distributions. The mutual information
of each can be computed by running:

```
python find_mutual_inf_sample.py
```

The mutual information between each distribution will be printed to
the terminal.

One may also estimate the error margins for a MI calculation by using
bootstrapping. An example is provided by running:

```
python bootstrap_sample.py
```
